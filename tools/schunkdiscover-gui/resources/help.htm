<p>
    Devices that are powered up and connected to the local network or
    directly to a computer can be found using the standard GigE VisionÂ®
    discovery mechanism. At startup, all available devices
    are listed with their name, serial number, current IP, and unique MAC
    address. The discovery tool finds all devices reachable by global
    broadcasts. Misconfigured devices that are located in different subnets
    than the computer may also be listed. An icon in the discovery tool
    indicates whether devices are actually reachable via a web browser.
    A rescan can be initiated by clicking on <em>Rerun Discovery</em>
</p>

<p>
    After successful discovery, select the device row and  clicking the <em>Open</em> button will 
    open the Web GUI of the device in the default web browser of the
    operating system if it is reachable.
</p>


<H2><a name="forceip" id="forceip">Assigning a temporary IP address</a></H2>
<p>
    In case a device is not reachable from the computer, it can
    be assigned a temporary IP address by clicking the <em>Open</em> button. 
    The device IP will set automatically according to the host PC connected interface IP and will open 
    the application in default browser.
</p>

<p>
    Setting a temporary IP is useful for making a device with misconfigured
    network settings reachable for web browsers and schunk2DGraspingDiscovery-gui 
    client. The settings are only valid until the device is restarted.
</p>

<H2><a name="forcepermip" id="forcepermip">Assigning a permanent IP address</a></H2>

<p>
    In case a device is not reachable from the computer, it can also
    be assigned a permanent IP address by clicking the <em>Set permanent
    IP </em> button. In the popup, the device can then
    either be selected from the drop down menu.
</p>

<p>
    The fields for <em>IP address</em>,
    <em>subnet mask</em> and <em>standard gateway</em> need to be completed.
    The subnet mask and the standard gateway are automatically set to default
    values that can be changed. By clicking <em>Set permanent IP</em>,
    these values are applied.
</p>

<p>
    If this operation was successful, after clicking
    <em>Rerun discovery</em>, the device will be listed
    with its new IP address.
</p>

<p>
    Setting a permanent IP is useful for setting a device IP address permanently.
    The newly set IP persistent even after restart.  The default IP settings can be 
    retreived back only by factory reset of device .
